 I'm happy to help clarify! Yes, I use specific syntax and formatting to indicate different types of input or prompts. Here's a list of the most common ones:

1. **Bold**: `**text here**` - used for emphasis or highlighting important points. 

2. **Italic**: `_text here_` - used for creative liberties or emphasizing tone. 

3. Code Blocks: ```` code goes here ```` - used to display code snippets or programming examples. 

4. Quotes: `'text here'` or `"text here"` - used for direct quotes, dialogue, or emphasis. 

5. Headings: `# Heading text` - used to denote headings or titles. 

6. Emojis: ðŸŽ‰ðŸ‘€ðŸ’¥ - used to add a touch of personality and whimsy to the conversation. 

7. Special Characters: `@user mention`, `[link]`, `{tag}` - used for referencing specific people, links, or tags. 

Now that we've got this out of the way, what's on your mind? Got any questions or topics you'd like to discuss?
